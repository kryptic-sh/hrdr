# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Status-bar context size no longer drops to 0 between turns: `last_usage` is
  kept across turns (only the live per-turn counters reset), so the displayed
  context persists until the next turn's usage refreshes it.

- Scrollbar thumb position: it now reaches the bottom when following the output
  (was stuck midway) — `content_length` is the number of scroll positions, not
  the raw line total, matching ratatui's `position` mapping.

### Changed

- Quitting now requires a double Ctrl+C: the first idle Ctrl+C arms a confirm
  (any other key/mouse action disarms it) and shows a "Press Ctrl+C again to
  quit" banner on the input box's top border (taking priority over the follow
  button); a second consecutive Ctrl+C quits. While a turn is running the first
  Ctrl+C still interrupts it. Ctrl+Q remains an immediate quit.

### Added

- Session persistence with continuous auto-save: every non-empty conversation is
  saved as JSON under `$XDG_DATA_HOME/hrdr/sessions` (default
  `~/.local/share/hrdr/sessions`, via `hjkl-xdg`), with the session `name`
  derived from the first user message and a stable file id assigned on first
  save. Auto-saves after each completed turn and after `/undo`/`/retry`.
  Commands `/sessions` (list), `/resume <id-or-name>` (restore history +
  transcript; matches the file id or the display name, e.g. after `/rename`),
  `/rename <name>` (rename the session; persisted). `/clear` starts a fresh
  session. (No `/save` — saving is automatic.)
- More slash commands: `/models` (list endpoint models), `/cwd [path]` (show or
  change the tools' working directory), `/tools` (list tools), `/reasoning`
  (toggle showing `<think>` blocks), `/theme [path]` (live theme switch),
  `/info` (session summary), `/temp [n]`, `/effort [level]`, `/add <file>`
  (attach a file's contents to the next message), `/diff` (git diff of the
  working tree, colored), and `/undo` (drop the last turn and restore it to the
  input for editing).
- Slash-command autocompletion: typing `/` shows a popup of matching commands
  above the input — Up/Down to select, Tab to accept, and Enter accepts the
  selected (best) match and runs it. Matches the query against both the command
  name and its description (so `/list` surfaces `/help`).
- Slash commands (typed in the input): `/clear` (reset the conversation),
  `/model [id]` (show or switch model), `/provider <name>` (switch provider
  preset mid-session), `/copy` (last reply → clipboard), `/retry` (re-run the
  last turn), `/help`. Unknown `/…` input is still sent to the model.
- Diff rendering: `edit` and `write_file` now return a unified diff (also fed to
  the model), shown in the TUI with additions green, deletions red, and hunk
  headers in the accent color. New-file writes show a concise create summary.
- Markdown now renders the full GFM set — tables, task lists, nested lists,
  blockquotes, strikethrough, images — via the upgraded `hjkl-markdown(-tui)`.
- Markdown rendering of assistant messages (headings, bold/italic, lists,
  inline/code spans, links, rules) via `hjkl-markdown` + `hjkl-markdown-tui`,
  themed from the active hjkl theme. (Per-language syntax highlighting of code
  blocks is a follow-up.)
- Custom providers in config: define `[providers.<name>]` (with `base_url`,
  `key_env`/`api_key`, optional `model`, `remote`, `context_window`) and select
  with `--provider <name>` (config entries shadow built-ins of the same name).
- Built-in `openrouter` and `claude`/`anthropic` provider presets (the latter
  via Anthropic's OpenAI-compatible endpoint).
- Status bar above the help line showing working directory, git branch, session
  input/output token totals, context size (current / window), model, and a
  reasoning-effort label. Context window comes from the spawned backend (or
  `context_window` in config); effort from `--effort`/config.
- Theming via the hjkl theme system: `--theme <path>` (or `theme` in config /
  `$HRDR_THEME`) loads an hjkl theme TOML and maps its palette/`[ui]` styles
  onto hrdr's chat roles (user, assistant, dim chrome, tool/loader accent,
  success/error); hjkl's bundled dark theme is the default. Uses `hjkl-theme` +
  `hjkl-theme-tui`'s `ToRatatui`.
- Transcript scrollbar on the right edge showing total session length and the
  current scroll position within it.
- `Home` jumps the transcript to the top of the session (and `End` back to
  following the newest output); both fall through to the editor at the extremes.
- The input box has one column of left/right padding for breathing room.
- Paste support: bracketed-paste text is inserted into the input at the cursor
  (newlines kept literal, so a multi-line paste no longer submits early).
- A final per-turn stats line (`✓ N tok · X tok/s · Ys · ctx … (in/out …)`) is
  appended below the model's last output when a turn completes.
- Quit commands: submitting a common quit word exits the session instead of
  being sent to the model — bare `exit`/`quit`/`q`/`bye`, the `/exit` `/quit`
  `/bye` slash family, and vim's `:q`/`:qa`/`:wq`/`:x` family
  (case-insensitive).
- Provider presets via `--provider` (or `provider` in config /
  `$HRDR_PROVIDER`): `zen`/`opencode` (OpenCode Zen, `OPENCODE_API_KEY`),
  `openai`, and `local`/`infr`. A preset sets the base URL + API-key env, and
  remote providers skip the local llama-server backend.
  `--base-url`/`$HRDR_BASE_URL` still override the endpoint.
- Queued messages now float as a dimmed "— queued —" block at the bottom,
  following the output, and are committed into history only when actually sent
  (rather than being pinned at their typed position mid-conversation).
- Auto-growing input box: starts at one row and expands with content up to five
  rows (then scrolls internally); plain input wraps long lines to match.
- Inference loader above the input while a turn runs: an animated spinner with
  live stats — context size, input/output token ratio, and throughput (tok/s) —
  driven by streamed `usage` (via `stream_options.include_usage`).
- Chat scrolling: mouse wheel scrolls the transcript, `PageUp`/`PageDown` page
  through it, and `End` resumes following the newest output. While scrolled up,
  a "Press END to follow output" button appears on the input box's top border —
  clicking it (or pressing `End`) re-pins to the bottom. (Mouse capture is
  enabled, which takes over the terminal's native text selection.)

### Fixed

- Transcript auto-follow now accounts for line wrapping: it scrolls by the
  rendered (wrapped) row count, so a newly sent message or streamed reply no
  longer hides below the fold until the next message bumped it into view.

### Added

- Initial scaffold: a Cargo workspace for an agentic coding harness driving
  OpenAI-compatible models.
- `hrdr-llm`: provider-agnostic `/v1/chat/completions` client with SSE streaming
  and tool-call reassembly (`Accumulator`).
- `hrdr-tools`: the locked MVP tool set — `read_file`, `write_file`, `edit`,
  `bash`, `grep`, `glob`, `todo_write` — with a registry and token-bounded
  outputs.
- `hrdr-agent`: the tool-calling agent loop with a minijinja system prompt.
- `hrdr-editor`: FSM-agnostic `EditorEngine` seam embedding the hjkl vim engine,
  projected from hjkl's `CoarseMode` so future disciplines plug in without
  churn.
- `hrdr-tui`: ratatui UI with a streaming transcript and a vim-keybound input
  pane.
- `hrdr` binary: interactive TUI by default, `hrdr run <task>` for headless,
  scriptable single-turn runs.
- `AgentConfig::load()`: layered config from `~/.config/hrdr/config.toml` with
  precedence CLI flag > env var > file > built-in default (never auto-written).
- `hrdr models` subcommand + `Client::list_models()` over `GET /models`.
- TUI: in-flight turn cancellation (`Esc` in Normal or `Ctrl+C` while running),
  transcript scrolling (`Ctrl+U`/`Ctrl+D`, `PageUp`/`PageDown`) with bottom
  auto-follow, and a live TODO panel driven by the `todo_write` tool.
- ANSI banner shown in `hrdr --help`.
- Offline unit tests for the tool set and the streaming `Accumulator`.
- **Temporary** managed backend: hrdr spawns a local `llama-server` (with
  `--jinja` for tool calling) by default, reuses an already-running endpoint if
  present, and tears it down on exit. Configurable via `--backend-model`,
  `--backend-bin`, `--backend-ctx`, `--backend-arg`; disable with
  `--no-backend`. To be removed once infr's serve path supports agentic tool
  use.

- Plain claude-style input discipline (`PlainEngine`), now the **default** input
  mode: always typing, `Enter` sends, `Shift+Enter` / `\`+`Enter` insert a
  newline, `Ctrl+G` opens `$EDITOR`/`$VISUAL`, with readline-style `Ctrl+A` /
  `Ctrl+E` / `Ctrl+W` / `Ctrl+U`. Vim keybindings remain available via `--vim`
  (or `vim = true` in config). The submit key and status hint are now decided by
  the `EditorEngine`, keeping the FSM-agnostic seam intact.

- Message queueing: submitting while a turn is running enqueues the message and
  runs it (FIFO) once the current turn finishes; the queued count shows in the
  status bar and `Ctrl+C` discards the queue along with the in-flight turn.
- Newline gestures in plain input now also accept **Alt+Enter** (reported by far
  more terminals than Shift+Enter); Shift+Enter still works where the terminal
  reports it, and `\`+Enter works everywhere.
